## What is Open Volunteer Platform?

An open-source platform for managing volunteer events from start to finish.

I originally built this project for an organization that needed a better way to organize volunteer opportunities, manage event owners, and keep track of registrations. After seeing how well it worked in production, I decided to remove all organization-specific branding and release it as a generic platform that anyone can build on.

Whether you're a nonprofit, school, community group, or company, Open Volunteer Platform gives you a solid foundation for running volunteer programs without starting from scratch.

## Why I Open Sourced This

There are plenty of event management platforms out there, but many are either expensive, overly complicated, or locked behind subscriptions.

My goal was to create something that's clean, modern, easy to understand, and free for anyone to use or improve.

If this project saves you time or helps your organization, that's a win.
